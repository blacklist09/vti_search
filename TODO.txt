TODO:

- consolidate queues, and refactor
- check if sequential saving of report files (e.g., *.raw) leads to significant delays
  (potentially change this to asynchronous processing as well)
- support processing livehunt notifications
- support looking up URLs and domains when information is provided via a file (-f) rather than
  via a query ( - for intelligence searches, looking up domains and URLs is already supported)
- support sort options for Intelligence searches
